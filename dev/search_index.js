Compared to the original FaST-LMM algorithm, we first project out the (optional) covariates, incl. an (optional) constant off-set (mean=true), from the response vector and the kernel matrix. This avoids all matrix computations in the variance parameter estimation, but means all variance estimates are restricted maximum-likelihood estimates (REMLs). Estimates for the fixed effects beta are not computed.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"FaST-LMM/#SpatialOmicsGPs.delta_mle_fullrank","page":"FaST-LMM","title":"SpatialOmicsGPs.delta_mle_fullrank","text":"delta_mle_fullrank(λ, yr)\n\nCompute the MLE of the variance ratio δ given the eigenvalues of the kernel matrix and the rotated response vector by solving the non-convex optimization problem formulated in the FaST-LMM paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"FaST-LMM/#SpatialOmicsGPs.minus_log_like_fullrank","page":"FaST-LMM","title":"SpatialOmicsGPs.minus_log_like_fullrank","text":"minus_log_like_fullrank(δ, λ, yr)\n\nCompute the minus log-likelihood of the model, scaled by the number of samples and without constant factors, given the variance ratio δ, the eigenvalues of the kernel matrix, the rotated response vector and (optionally) the rotated covariates.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"FaST-LMM/#SpatialOmicsGPs.sigma2_mle_fullrank","page":"FaST-LMM","title":"SpatialOmicsGPs.sigma2_mle_fullrank","text":"sigma2_mle_fullrank(δ, λ, yr)\n\nCompute the MLE of the variance parameter given the variance ratio δ, the eigenvalues of the kernel matrix, and the rotated response vector.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"FaST-LMM/#SpatialOmicsGPs.project_orth_covar","page":"FaST-LMM","title":"SpatialOmicsGPs.project_orth_covar","text":"project_orth_covar(y, K, X)\n\nProject out the covariates from the response vector and the kernel matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"FaST-LMM/#SpatialOmicsGPs.softplus","page":"FaST-LMM","title":"SpatialOmicsGPs.softplus","text":"softplus(x)\n\nCompute the softplus function, i.e. log(1 + exp(x)), element-wise.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"listfunctions/","page":"List of functions","title":"List of functions","text":"CurrentModule = SpatialOmicsGPs","category":"page"},{"location":"listfunctions/#List-of-package-functions","page":"List of functions","title":"List of package functions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"listfunctions/","page":"List of functions","title":"List of functions","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"CurrentModule = SpatialOmicsGPs","category":"page"},{"location":"#SpatialOmics.jl-Documentation","page":"Introduction","title":"SpatialOmics.jl Documentation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Table-of-contents","page":"Introduction","title":"Table of contents","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"","category":"page"}]
